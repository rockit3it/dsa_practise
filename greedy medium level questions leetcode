Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.

You are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.

Initially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

code:
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    class Pair {
        int profit;
        int cap;
        
        public Pair(int profit, int cap) {
            this.profit = profit;
            this.cap = cap;
        }
    }
    
    public int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int w, int[] profits, int[] capital) {
        List<Pair> al = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < profits.length; i++) {
            al.add(new Pair(profits[i], capital[i]));
        }
        al.sort((a, b) -> Integer.compare(a.cap, b.cap));
        
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        
        int i = 0;
        while (k > 0) {
            while (i < al.size() && al.get(i).cap <= w) {
                pq.add(al.get(i).profit);
                i++;
            }
            if (pq.isEmpty()) break;
            
            // Choose the project with the maximum profit from pq
            w += pq.poll();
            k--;
        }

   return w;
    }

330. Patching Array

Given a sorted integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in the range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array.

Return the minimum number of patches required.
code:
Input: nums = [1,3], n = 6
Output: 1
Explanation:
Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.
Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].
Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].
So we only need 1 patch.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,5,10], n = 20
Output: 2
Explanation: The two patches can be [2, 4].


code:
class Solution {
    public int minPatches(int[] nums, int n) {
        long maxReach = 0;
        int count = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while(maxReach < n){
            if(i < nums.length && nums[i] <= maxReach+1){
                maxReach += nums[i];
                i++;
            }
            else{
                maxReach += maxReach + 1;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
